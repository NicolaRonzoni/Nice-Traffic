The aim is to identify different seasonal and weekly paths of the traffic over the periods considered, and try to study the impact of the restrictions due to Covid-19 in the traffic dynamic. The data are used concerning their temporal order, daily time series are created with respect to the variables at disposition. In the first section the techniques and algorithms used are presented with a theoretical approach. In the second section Promenade Des Anglais data are considered; after having explain the pre-process implemented results are showed for both 2019 and 2020. In the third section Voie Mathis data are analyzed; after having explain the preliminary steps results are showed using different perspectives.

    "In order to identify seasonal and weekly traffic paths, using daily time series, clustering procedures are proposed. Clustering is the task of dividing the time series data into a number of groups such that data in the same group are more similar. They  present analogous behaviours during the day. To better identify the trajectory represented by a group (cluster) a barycenter, also call centroid, is computed. Since I am dealing with temporal data I have to define a strategy in order to compare different series both to assign each series in a cluster and update the centroid. I would need a dissimilarity measure that is able to “match” a point of a time series $x$ even with “surrounding” points of time series $y$. The Euclidean distance assumes the $i-th$ point of the $x$ series is aligned with the $i-th$ point of the $y$ series. It will produce a pessimistic dissimilarity measure. Two clustering procedures are discussed below: Soft-Dynamic Time Warping with K-means algorithm and Global Alignment kernel (GAK) inside of a Kernel K-means algorithm. The two procedure are connected each other and they can be used together as showed later. \n",

The second cluster $k=1$ represents no-working days (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) out of restriction periods, in which the highest level of traffic is reached between 17:00-20:00 and the morning peak is absent. The first cluster $k=0$ and the fifth one $k=4$ identifies the most trafficated days.

    "Through this project, the softDTW seeded with K-means and GAK seeded with Kernel K-means are proposed as clustering methods. Both softDTW and GAK are proposed as alternative to the Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping. However in literature is not yet explain if one method is better than the other, hence the idea of use them together. Both techniques used perform well in identify seasonal and daily paths of the traffic. For Promenade the traffic detected by the airport detector (C601) is different from the traffic detected by central located detectors (C009/C094). Central located detectors show level of traffic in the month of August different from the one registered by the airport detector. In addition Thursdays and Fridays in the month of June, September, October and December seems to be more trafficated in the night hours, due to the proximity of central detectors to the City centre and the sea. The shock on the traffic dynamic due to the first lockdown, studied with Promenade data, reveals the dependency of the traffic to the reopening of activities. For Voie Mathis due to the greatest amount of usable detectors two perspectives are proposed. To better identifies the days without \"school effect\" the aggregation of occupancy rate time series of all detectors seems to have better result. The shock on the traffic dynamic due to the second lockdown, studied with Voie Mathis data, seems less prolonged in the time with respect to the first one analyzed with Promenade data.  "
